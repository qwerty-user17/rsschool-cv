ABOUT ME

I enjoy programming and solving problems put in front of me. At the moment I am taking different courses and improving my knowledge. Since I have a part-time job I can devote more time to it. My plans are to learn Java Script, as well as several libraries to it, and then try myself in the development of applications and utilities for Telegram. I will be very happy if I get an opportunity to work with experienced mentors and gain practical experience in interesting and unusual projects.
